              Conveying that difference and giving people a reason to care about
              you more than your competition can make the difference between
              someone making a one-time purchase and forgetting who you are, to
              becoming a loyal brand advocate. Certainly, that’s a lot of weight
              to put on one website page, and it takes more than just one page
              to become a beloved brand (like having a good product and an
              actual mission, things no amount of content can cover up). But,
              they do help, and they’re great because they let you put that
              story front and center.
